Example 10a -  Crustal Density Profiles
--------------------------------------
This notebook shows how to convert pressure to depth using a variety of density profiles and how to compare them.

:doc:`Example 10a <Examples\Converting_Pressures_to_depths/Example10a_Different_Crustal_Density_Profiles>`

This notebook shows how to make plots where you show an axis for both pressure and depth, even when the relationship isnt linear

:doc:`Example 10b <Examples\Converting_Pressures_to_depths/Example10b_Plotting_Pressure_and_depth_together>` shows how to compare different crustal density profiles you may want to use to convert fluid inclusion pressures to depths.
