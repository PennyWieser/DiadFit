Modelling Fluid inclusion re-equilibration
===============================================
These examples show how to use the code of DeVitre and Wieser (2024) to model fluid inclusion re-equilibration during ascent towards the surface.

Example 9a -  Stretching during ascent
--------------------------------------
:doc:`Example 9a <Examples/Modelling_Fluid_Inclusion_Re-equilibration/Example9a_FI_stretching_during_ascent>`  shows how to model stretching of a 1 um radius CO2 fluid inclusion during ascent from 10 km depth to the surface.
This can be easily adapted for different starting pressures, inclusion sizes, and ascent rates

Example 9b -  Stretching during quenching
--------------------------------------
:doc:`Example 9b <Examples/Modelling_Fluid_Inclusion_Re-equilibration/Example9b_FI_stretching_slow_quenching_at_surface>` shows how to model fluid inclusion stretching that occurs during syn-eruptive quenching on the surface (e.g. in a lava flow)

Example 9c -  Stretching during stalling
--------------------------------------
:doc:`Example 9c <Examples/Modelling_Fluid_Inclusion_Re-equilibration/Example9c_FI_stretching_during_stalling>` shows how to model fluid inclusion stretching that occurs after a magma and stalls in a shallower reservoir.
