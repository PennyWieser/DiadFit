This is a python package in progress allowing users to fit Ne lines, Fermi diads and carbonate peaks.


Spectra included as examples:

1. Strong Diad with carbonate
headless_txt_FG18_6_MI1.txt: Headless txt file from Witec showing a strong diad, hot bands and C13 

See Peak_Fitting_headlesstxt_Gaussian.ipynb to fit this using a Gaussian background + 5 voigt peaks


2. Weak Diad no carbonate
WITEC_ASCII_MS14_11_MI1_50X.txt: WITEC ASCII file (e.g. metadata + data), Diad and very weak hotbands
See Diad_Fitting_WITEC_Weak.ipynb for how to fit this
